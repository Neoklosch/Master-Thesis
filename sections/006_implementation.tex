\section{Used external libraries}
This section will show up some of the most important libraries used in the motey engine.
Each library will be introduced briefly and the reason for using it in the project will be shown.

\paragraph{daemonize} allows to run a services as a daemon process.
It is made exclusively for Unix-like systems.
The library will create a pid file after starting the service.
In the motey engine, the file path can be configured via a configuration file.
The daemon process can be controlled via a command line interface.
\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:cli-tool,caption=Command line interface documentation for the daemon process]
Motey command line tool.

Usage:
  motey start
  motey stop
  motey restart
  motey -h | --help
  motey --version

 Options:
   -h, --help       Show this message.
   --version        Print the version.
\end{lstlisting}
After the motey engine is installed via the setup script, this command line tool will be available in the terminal.

\paragraph{dependency-injector} is a microframework for \acf{DI} in Python.
The \ac{DI} pattern allows to move the responsibility for creating a dependency from the concrete objects to a factory or a framework which creates the dependency graph.
This grants the single responsibility concept for classes and makes the whole code base much easier to unit test, because a dummy object can be passed to the constructor of the class.
It is also possible to mocked the object with the help of a mocking library.
To realize \ac{DI} in the prototype a so called \textit{app\_module.py} was created which uses the \textit{dependency-injector} framework to create the dependency graph.
Several \ac{IoC} containers are created in that file and will be used by the framework to generate the glue code.
Most of the injected components are instanciated as singleton objects to guarantee that there is only one active instance of that component at a time.
The implementation of the singleton design pattern is also provided by the framework.
Listing \ref{code:app-module} demonstrates the implementation of such an \ac{IoC} container.
\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:app-module,caption=Extract of a sample \ac{IoC} container from the app\_module.py]
class DIRepositories(containers.DeclarativeContainer):
    capability_repository = providers.Singleton(CapabilityRepository)
    nodes_repository = providers.Singleton(NodesRepository)
    service_repository = providers.Singleton(ServiceRepository)
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Docker \ac{SDK}}
\todo{Write it}

\paragraph{Flask} is a framework to create web applications.
Flask does not provide any templating or database engine, nor does it enforce a specific file structure.
Instead it will support extensions to add functionalities like that so that the developer can choose the tools of choice.\autocite[cf.]{Flask:Documentation:Foreword}
Nevertheless Flask is production ready and is used in several big projects like Pinterest\autocite{Quora:Pinterest:Flask} or Twilio\autocite{Twilio:Flask}.
The simplest sample implementation of a web application with one \ac{URL} endpoint is shown in listing \ref{code:flask-sample}.
\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:flask-sample,caption=Sample Flask web application]
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello_world():
    return 'Hello, World!'
\end{lstlisting}

\todo{write more about Flask}
\todo{description what i do in code with it}

\paragraph{Logbook} is a small loging library that helps to standardize the output of log messages.
It helps to address several output methods like the terminal, a file or even emails and linux desktop notifications.
The style of the resulting message can be easily configured and it can be integrated into several other libraries.
In addition to that, Logbook has a build-in support for messaging libraries like ZeroMQ, RabbitMQ or Redis.
This allows to distribute log messages on heavily distributed systems like a huge node cluster.
It was created by Armin Ronacher the crator of Flask and Georg Brandl the creator of Sphinx, both are tools that are used in motey.
Unfortunately there is no build-in support in Flask yet.
In the motey engine Logbook will be extended by a wrapper class to simplify the configuration of the tool.
The output folder for the log messages can be configured via the global config file and will be loaded in the constructor of the wrapper class.
If the folder path does not exist, it will be created.

\paragraph{paho-mqtt} is the python implementation of the Eclipse paho\footnote{\url{http://www.eclipse.org/paho}} project that is basically the implementation of the \ac{MQTT} messaging protocols, which was already described in section \ref{section:MQTT}.
The libarary allows to connect to a \ac{MQTT} broker like the Mosquitto broker.
It also comes with a variety of helper methods to eases the usage.
A wrapper class to centralize the usage of the library was created and the configuration as well as some smaller improvements was made in this wrapper class.
The whole configuration of the client can be configures via the global config file again.
Furthermore the routes are managed in the wrapper and a after connect handler was implemented.
It will be used to perform actions after a successfully created connection to the broker was made and all subscriptions to topics are done.
This helps to realize the node discovery mechanism described in section \ref{subsection:CommunicationLayer}.

\paragraph{pyzmq} is the third important communication library.
It is the official Python binding for ZeroMQ.
A detailed description of ZeroMQ can be found in section \ref{section:ZeroMQ} and in the great ZeroMQ guide at \url{http://zguide.zeromq.org/page:all}.
This library is also abstracted by wrapper class in motey.
This helps to configure the ZeroMQ server and register all necessary nodes.
A detailed explanition of the internals will be discussed in the following section \ref{section:implementation-communication-layer}.

\paragraph{Sphinx} is a tool to autogenerate a documentation out of the source code documentation.
It supports several output formats like \ac{HTML}, \LaTeX\ or ePub and is the defacto standard in Python.
The documentation hosting platform Read the Docs\footnote{\url{http://readthedocs.org}} completely supports Sphinx documentations.
As mentioned before the Makefile in the docs folder will be used to autogenerate the documentation files.
The scripts handles also the deployment of the documentation.
Therefore the files will be generated, the current branch will be switched to \textit{gh-pages}, which is be used to display the github page at \url{https://neoklosch.github.io/Motey/} and a new commit will be pushed with an autogenerated commit message.
Finally the branch will be switched back again.
Read the Docs has an active webhook that builds the builds the current documentation and display them at \url{http://motey.readthedocs.io}.
The documentation is also used as the official github page of the project at \url{https://neoklosch.github.io/Motey}.

\paragraph{TinyDB} is a wrapper to implement a lightweight document oriented database.
It stores the data into single \ac{JSON} files.
The location can be configured via the global config file.
TinyDB only supports very basic functionalities.
For example it does not support indexes or relationships and it is not optimised concerning performance.
But it is easy to use, has no execution overhead and it performs very well on smaller datasets.
The main purpose of the library is to be used for small apps where database server like MySQL\footnote{\url{https://www.mysql.com}} or MongoDB\footnote{\url{https://www.mongodb.com}} will be a huge overhead.
Furthermore TinyDB has several extension to add more functionalities like indexing or caching.
It also allows to easily extend the library with custom middlewares and extensions.
\todo{description what i do in code with it}

\paragraph{Yapsy} is a plugin system that was designed to make an application easily extensible and should also be easy to use.
Several plugin systems are too complicated for a basic usage or have a huge dependency overhead.
Yapsy claims to be different, because it is written in pure Python and can be used with only a few lines of code.
In the motey engine all \ac{VAL} plugins will be loaded via Yapsy.
An extract of the ValManager with the method to register the plugins, is shown in listing \ref{code:yapsy-register-plugins}.
\begin{lstlisting}[label=code:yapsy-register-plugins,caption=Extract of the ValManager with the method to register plugins]
def register_plugins(self):
  self.plugin_manager.setPluginPlaces(directories_list=[absolute_file_path("motey/val/plugins")])
  self.plugin_manager.collectPlugins()
  for plugin in self.plugin_manager.getAllPlugins():
      plugin.plugin_object.activate()
\end{lstlisting}
In motey there is a specific folder where all images has to be located (line 2).
This could be extended in the future if necessary.
Afterwards all the valid plugins will be loaded and activated (line 3).
Finally for all activated plugins the \textit{activate} method will be executed, which is a custom implementation to call some functions after activating a plugin (line 4 and 5).
All plugins can be used via the \textit{self.plugin\_manager}.
