\chapter{Evaluation}\label{chapter:evaluation}
% In this chapter the implementation of Component X is evaluated. An example instance
% was created for every service. The following chapter validates the component implemented
% in the previous chapter against the requirements.
% Put some screenshots in this section! Map the requirements with your proposed solution.
% Compare it with related work. Why is your solution better than a concurrent
% approach from another organization?
In this chapter the implementation of the plugins, based on the previously defined requirements and concepts, are evaluated.
Afterwards a demonstration of the system will be shown.
