\chapter{Requirements Analysis}\label{chapter:requirements-analysis}
% This section determines the requirements necessary for X. This includes the functional
% aspects, namely Y and Z, and the non functional aspects such as A and B.
Based on the fundamentals the requirements for the plugin to be developed will be formulated in this chapter.
Thereby aspects that will be relevant for the specific implementation will be considered.

\section{Overview}
% In this chapter you will describe the requirements for your component. Try to group the
% requirements into subsections such as ’technical requirements’, ’functional requirements’,
% ’social requirements’ or something like this. If your component consist of different partial
% components you can also group the requirements for the corresponding parts.
% Explain the source of the requirements.
% Example: The requirements for an X have been widely investigated by Organization
% Y.
% In his paper about Z, Mister X outlines the following requirements for a Component
% X
\doit

% Based on Open Baton
% Docker Plugin as Vim Driver
% should replace OpenStack, etc
% Should deploy container on the NVFs
% images should be found by the registry

% constraints noch unklar
% based on schema on clients/NVFs/Server? -> have to be installed before everything else?
% based on realtime detection on nodes?
% should only the server have these information or should the node himself have the infromations/schema and can provide it?

\section{Technical requirements}
% The following subsection outlines the technical requirements to Component X.
\doit

% Open Baton has to be configured
% the plugins have to be installed (VIM Driver, VNFM(?))
% Docker has to be installed
% node must be able to execute docker and open baton client software

\section{Functional requirements}
\doit

\section{Technologies}
\doit

% Java as language because Open Baton is writen in it
% go and python not completely implemented yet
% management should be included in the existing dashboard
% GUI based on ?
% Docker as container virtualization tool
% yaml for schema

\section{Use-Case-Analysis}
\doit
% Deploy VNFs in factory (e.g. mass production, tracking of stuff)
% ad hoc deployment if truck arives at factory
% detect the right nodes, e.g. software needs specific sensor or latency

\section{Delineation from existing solutions}
\doit

% Kubernetes and Docker Swarm
% Cloudify (what else?)
% Open Baton with OpenStack

\section{Conclusion}
