\chapter{Concept}\label{chapter:concept}
% This chapter introduces the architectural design of Component X. The component consists
% of subcomponent A, B and C.
% In the end of this chapter you should write a specification for your solution, including
% interfaces, protocols and parameters.
This chapter introduces the architectural design of plugin respect to the previously defined requirements.
Therefore the used development environment will be analyzed.
Followed by the initial architecture of the plugin to be developed.
Based on that the different layer of the system will be elaborated.

\section{Overview}
% The concept chapter provides a high-level explanation of your solution. Try to explain
% the overall structure with a picture. You can also use UML sequence diagrams for
% explanation.

Open Baton is written in Java and is also partly ported to python and go.

\textbf{Java:}

\textbf{Python:}

\textbf{Go:}

Beside the fact that there is no complete implementation in the latter, the plugin will be written in Java.
